// The name of your mod's folder is its "identifier".
// No two mods can share the same folder name / identifier, so make it unique!
// I recommend "your_name.mod_name".

// This particular mod is a "translation" mod. There's actually nothing special
// about translation mods; they're just regular mods that typically have no "actions"
// only language files.

// You must give a human-readable name for your mod. This is what will be shown in the user interface.
Name = "CosmoteerCN"

// The version of the mod that will be shown in the user interface. This is optional.
Version = 1.0.0

// The name of the mod creator(s) that will be shown in the user interface. This is optional.
Author = "GalAster"

// A longer description of what your mod does to the game. This is optional.
Description = "Cosmoteer中文汉化."

// Mods can define their own per-language string files.
// The values in a string file (such as en.txt) will add to
// and override any values in the base string file (such as Data\Strings\en.txt).
// Each language supported should have its own string file named
// after the two-letter 639-1 language code for that language.
//
// A translation mod typically provides an entirely-new language instead of
// overriding or adding to the languages supported in the base game.
//
// Once a translation mod is enabled, the player should be able to select any
// language(s) added by the mod in the interface settings.
